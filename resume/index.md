## Crafter of Useful Experiences
I love working with designers to create fantastic user experiences that help people complete their task quickly and efficiently. I accomplish this by using modern web best practices to write efficient, scalable and readable code.

## Collaborator
Everyone involved in a product brings unique perspectives to a project and their input is valuable in creating a great user experience. Noodling on a problem with others is something I really enjoy.[^1] Sometimes adding a good cup of coffee or a slice of pizza helps.

## Creating Fine Things
User experience engineering requires knowledge and integration of many types of technology. Finding creative solutions is a cornerstone of every project I work on.

## Bridging Designers and Engineers
Having a background in technology and a passion for user experience allows me to fuse the design and engineering disciplines together. This gives me a unique perspective in collaborating with both engineers and designers alike.

## Learning
I am constantly learning new things, tackling bigger challenges, and reading up on current (or upcoming) trends. This is necessary because web development industry is an ever-evolving environment of preprocessors, libraries and frameworks. Yes, I bought and blitzed through the first edition of Zeldman’s book.
