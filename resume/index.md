## Crafting Useful Experiences
I love crafting magical experiences that smooth the path a user takes to complete their task. Using modern web techniques that produce efficient, modular, clean and readable code is part of that craft.

## People and Teams
Designers, Engineers, and Product Managers all bring a unique perspective and their input is invaluable in creating a successful product. Collaborating with people smarter than I is something I really enjoy.[^1] This is almost as a good cup of coffee or a slice of artisan pizza (almost).

## Creating
Finding creative solutions to the challenges that are presented forms one of the cornerstones of every project I work on. LEGOs, model building[^2] and user experience development all require a level of creativity and skill that is unmatched in many other areas of life.

## Bridging Design and Engineering
Having a background in technology and a passion for user experience gives me a unique perspective in collaborating with both engineers and developers alike.

## Learning
I am constantly learning new things, tackling bigger challenges, and reading up on current (or upcoming) trends. The web development industry is an ever-evolving environment of preprocessors, libraries and frameworks; never standing still, but sprinting for a finish line that is not yet visible (and probably never will be). Yes, I bought and blitzed through the first edition of Zeldman’s book.
