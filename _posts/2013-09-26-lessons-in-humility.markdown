I've been thinking about starting journaling again. It comes as a bit of a surprise that my first entry back into this would be this&hellip;humbling.

Ouch. That stings. On September 23, 2013, something very humiliating happened to me — I was let go from my place of employment.

I had recently joined an early stage startup as Employee #5 (at least, that's what my pay stub said). The possibilities were endless. I was promised a great many things — autonomy, control over the entire user experience, a future as a leader of a group of User Experience Designers and Engineers, and of course, money and a whole lot of stock options.

I was sold — they got me hook, line, and sinker. So, in May 2012 I left a very stable job where I was respected and doing really well, for this early stage startup. It felt like I was joining the Silicon Valley party, where everyone who's anyone works for a startup. Big companies are where you go when you want to settle, not when you are on the cutting edge of your industry.

It wasn't until I had been with the company for a few months that I realized something was wrong. Try as I might, I cold never really fit in with the other people in the company. The team chemistry wasn't there and I was the outsider, always looking in, never being trusted, (nearly) every decision scrutinized and rebutted. This started to irritate me because it wasn't lining up with what I was told in the beginning. But, I was bound and determined to make it work though - the promise of a big paycheck someday[^1] wasn't something I could easily ignore.

So I soldiered on, meanwhile the stress was building up, the team getting bigger, the success of the company hinging on every release. I tried everything I knew to 'fit in' with the company culture. I tried going to lunch with the guys (it seemed they invited me begrudgingly), talking about our lives outside of work, relating to them in the things they were interested in.[^2] Nothing seemed to work, and it kept getting harder.

I started feeling like I was being ignored, overlooked, and important information that would help me make better decisions as I was working on projects with engineers was purposefully held from me (whether this was the case, I don't know).

I continued to try and make this thing work — someday, there would be a big payday, and I wanted to be there for it. I also started feeling like I had something to prove; I knew what I was talking about and I was promised control over the user experience after all.

Try as I might, I was never able fit in with this group of extremely talented engineers. The day I was let go and the days following, my emotions have run the gamut. Angry at them for what amounted to zero communication about any potential problem; frustrated that I couldn't make it work. Joyous that I was finally relieved of such a terrible situation; petrified at what was going to happen with my family[^3] that I am the only one bringing a paycheck home for; sadness over not being able to finish what I'd started; and humiliated that I was let go.

I'm starting to realize a few things through this situation — and am still realizing. There are certain things in a job that I need to be successful, and there are certain things I need to be mindful of within my own heart and mind.

## To be successful I need:
* **Someone who gives me freedom to be creative, but also the boundaries to be successful.**[^4]<br>Reflecting back, I had too much freedom and I ended up getting lost in all the tasks that needed to get done, rather than being able to focus on one or two things and do them well.[^5]
* **Support from my manager.**<br>If my manager doesn't know what I do, how can he support me? If my manager can't support me, then I've got no one on my team when the rubber meets the road, and a decision needs to be made that could affect the User Experience.
* **A product that is engaging and interesting.**<br>In my last three jobs, I've had some really amazing opportunities to learn and grow as a User Experience Engineer and the challenges I faced in bringing designs to life in code were killer. I had a great time learning all the new tips and tricks. But I didn't care at all about the product. It wasn't that I didn't believe in it, they just didn't generate any interest for me.
* **A team that is fun to be with.**<br>I'm going to be with these people 8, 10, 12+ hours a day, if we don't have "chemistry," then it's just going to be stressful for everyone involved. I love being around creative (designers AND engineers) people and working on solutions to make the product even better. Synergies!

In a fantastic article entitled, "Firing and Being Fired," Vibhu Norby says[^6]:
> People don't succeed long term at their job because they're just so good at what they do that nothing else matters. If they're at the right company, they have the right managers, or they love what they're doing, they'll succeed no matter how good they were when they started. Success at anything feeds on itself and delivers continuous fruits. 

## Things I need to be mindful of (and correct):
* **I am not inherently patient.**<br>I want things, and I want them now. I have recently experienced this financially several times over in bloated credit card bills. I have experienced this in not taking the time to properly learn how to design or engineer something. And I have experienced this in the time I have been looking for a new job. I want the answers now, and that's not going to happen. HR departments are inherently slow. Once the resumé has been submitted, it's out of my hands and I need to learn how to be patient.
* **I stink at not being in control.**<br>I pretend all the time that this one isn't really an issue for me, but it really is. I hate not controlling things in my life. This has manifested itself in so many ways — in wanting to structure my wife's day down to what tasks she's going to be doing.[^7] I know, sick, right? I have too much on my plate already and here I go, trying to control yet one more thing.
* **I am prideful and lack humility.**<br>Yes, everyone has issues with pride on some level. This experience has really brought me down a few notches, though. I've noticed that in the last two jobs, after I've been there long enough for the 'honeymoon phase' to wear off, and I start to really get grooving on my tasks, I start to get a bit prideful. I start to think, "I got this. Ain't no problem. Don't tell me how to do my job." This is a horrible attitude and only fosters bitterness in me towards my coworkers, and only makes my coworkers not want to be around me or even consult me on problems. I am viewed as antagonistic and berating. Talk about unhealthy working relationships&hellip;

Wow, this turned out to be a much longer post than I thought. I plan on revisiting this topic in a couple weeks to see where things are, and what progress I've made.
